### 🔍 Technical Deep Dive

My development journey is focused on bridging the gap between high-level software and low-level hardware. Here is a breakdown of my core areas of expertise:

* **💾 Low-Level & Hardware Engineering**
    Through projects like the **8086 Microprocessor System** and **SystemC ALU Modules**, I've explored computer architecture and hardware description. I specialize in writing efficient code that respects hardware constraints, utilizing **Assembly** and **SystemC** to model complex digital logic.

* **🐧 System Programming**
    My work in the **Operating Systems** domain reflects a deep dive into how kernels manage resources. I focus on process synchronization, memory management, and multi-threading, primarily developing in **C** within **Linux** environments to build robust system-level applications.

* **🌐 Full-Stack & Web Development**
    With the **Gym Manager** project, I’ve implemented a complete CRUD system using **Node.js** and **MongoDB**. This project demonstrates my ability to design scalable database schemas and handle asynchronous backend logic while maintaining a clean user interface.

* **🎮 Game Logic & GUI**
    Developing **Exploding Kittens** (CLI) and **TicTacToe** (SFML) allowed me to refine my **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** skills. These projects showcase my ability to implement complex game rules and real-time graphics rendering using **C++**.
